# Migrations not yet applied

Migrations are applied by hand in Lovable, so a migration can sit in this
repository for hours or days before the database has it. Code deployed in that
window must still work — see `scripts/migration-safety.ts`, which reads this
file.

**This list is a fallback.** When `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
are set, the script asks `list_applied_migrations` instead and ignores this
file entirely, because a hand-maintained list going stale is the same kind of
mistake it exists to prevent. Keep it current anyway, for anyone running
without credentials.

Delete a line once the migration is applied.

_Nothing pending. The eight queued on 2 Aug 2026 — contracting-ops-requests,
ensure-assigned-contract-status, scope-layer, analytics-authorization,
pending-agents, nova-conversations, help-desk and agency-resources — are all
applied._
